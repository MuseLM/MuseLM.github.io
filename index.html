<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Generating music from text descriptions is a user-friendly mode since the text is a relatively easy interface for user engagement. While some approaches utilize texts to control music audio generation, editing musical elements in generated audio is challenging for users. In contrast, symbolic music offers ease of editing, making it more accessible for users to manipulate specific musical elements. In this paper, we propose MuseLM, which generates symbolic music from text descriptions with musical attributes as the bridge to break down the task into text-to-attribute understanding and attribute-to-music generation stages. The system has two main advantages: Firstly, it is data efficient. In the attribute-to-music generation stage, the attributes can be directly extracted from music sequences, making the model training self-supervised. In the text-to-attribute understanding stage, the text is synthesized and refined by ChatGPT based on the defined attribute templates. Secondly, the system can achieve precise control with specific attributes in text descriptions and offers multiple control options through attribute-conditioned or text-conditioned approaches. MuseLM outperforms baseline systems in terms of musicality, controllability, and overall score by at least 1.27, 1.08, and 1.32 respectively. Besides, there is a notable enhancement of about 20% in objective control accuracy.</p>

<p>Please note: this work focuses on generating symbolic music, which do not contain timbre information. 
    We use MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) to export mp3 files for reference, musicians are encouraged to leverage the .mid files for further timbre improvement.</p>
